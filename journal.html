          <p>
            Welcome to my Journey. If we haven’t met yet, I’m Carlos Beltran — a Software Engineer, creative thinker, and challenge seeker with a passion for curiosity and growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since this is my Tech Journal (not a diary!), I’ll be sharing personal experiences from my journey in tech. To start, in August 2024, I was laid off from my role as a Software Engineer.          </p>
          <p>
            After that bad experience, I’ve been diving into LeetCode, building passion projects like this website, and have been fortunate to make it to a few final round interviews.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although I’m still navigating the job hunt, I want this to be a space where I share relatable experiences — to help you avoid some of the mistakes I’ve made and hopefully teach you something new along the way.          </p>
          <p>
            As for the next steps for my website, I have a few ideas I’d love to implement:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Add commenting so we, as a community, can communicate and engage</li>
            <li>Add notifications for when I publish new posts</li>
            <li>Create a learning center that teaches Computer Science concepts at a high level</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Feel free to contact me for any suggestions or feedback! — I’d love to hear from you.
          </p>
            <p>
            Best Wishes,
          </p>
            <p>
            Carlos Beltran.
