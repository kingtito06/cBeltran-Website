    <h2>About me</h2>
            <p class = about>I'm a software engineer with a curious mind, a creative edge, and a passion for continuous growth. My journey into tech began in high school, where I started coding in True BASIC and Java — and I've been hooked ever since.
In college, I deepened my skills with languages like C and Haskell, explored machine learning with Python, and built full-stack web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. One of my proudest achievements was creating a Unity game for my senior design project (with my team), which became a finalist among all projects in the College of Engineering and Computer Science.
Professionally, I've worked at General Motors, contributing to enterprise applications with technologies like AEM, React, TypeScript, Azure DevOps, and Strapi. I enjoy being both a builder and a problem solver — whether it's refining UI experiences or tackling backend logic.
I'm currently seeking software engineering roles that will challenge me and help me grow. I thrive in environments where I can learn fast, contribute meaningfully, and adapt to new technologies.
Outside of work, I'm a gamer at heart and a creative thinker. I've won a digital design award in high school and have experience with Adobe Photoshop, Premiere, and After Effects. When I'm not building something or learning a new framework, you'll probably find me walking with my dog Rocky or planning my next personal project.
If you're looking for a driven, versatile engineer who brings both technical depth and creative thinking to the table — let's connect.</p>

        <h2>Discord RPG Bot: A Text-Based Adventure with Evolving Dragons</h2>
    <p>
        I built an immersive, turn-based combat Discord bot in Java using Spring Boot and JDA (Java Discord API), designed to bring RPG-style mechanics into community servers. Inspired by classic role-playing games, the bot allows users to <strong>hatch, raise, and battle with dragons</strong> in a persistent game world.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Features:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dragon Evolution System:</strong> Users receive a dragon egg, which evolves over time into a dragonling and eventually a mighty dragon. Evolution is tracked using timestamps and JSON-based persistence.</li>
        <li><strong>Turn-Based Combat:</strong> Players can initiate combat against dynamically generated enemies, take turns attacking, and gain experience based on victory.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Battle Threads:</strong> Each battle occurs in its own Discord thread for clarity and immersion, showing real-time HP updates, turn management, and attack outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Experience and Progression:</strong> Dragons gain XP from combat, allowing for stat progression and future scalability for leveling, abilities, or forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Combat Engine:</strong> Built using modular services and utility classes for attack logic, timers, and status tracking, with a 1-second turn loop using <code>ScheduledExecutorService</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tech Stack:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Java + Spring Boot</strong> for scalable backend structure</li>
        <li><strong>JDA (Java Discord API)</strong> for Discord integration</li>
        <li><strong>JSON file-based persistence</strong> for user and dragon state tracking</li>
        <li><strong>Scheduled task system</strong> to handle timed evolution and combat turns</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This project demonstrates my ability to blend <strong>object-oriented design, asynchronous task management, and game mechanics</strong> into a fully interactive, community-driven bot. It’s a living platform I plan to expand with features like PvP battles, loot systems, and elemental abilities.
